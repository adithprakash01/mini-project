project title is "Predicting sales data using XG-BOOST".

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project aims to predict future sales based on historical data using the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm.The dataset includes features such as store information, product details, promotional offers, and previous sales records. 
The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to build an accurate predictive model. XGBoost is chosen for its high performance, speed, and ability to handle complex data relationships, helping businesses make data-driven decisions to improve inventory management and sales planning.

MAIN 2.PY:
The file "main-2.py" implements a sales prediction application using machine learning, focusing on regression modeling with XGBoost and a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.​

Modules Used:
streamlit: For creating web app interface.​
pandas, numpy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.​
xgboost: For regression modeling.​
scikit-learn: For data splitting and evaluation metrics.
